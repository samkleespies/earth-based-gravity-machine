# My Senior Design Project: Earth-Based Gravity Machine

### This repo contains all the files related to my Senior Design Project at UCF. 
  
The goal of this project was to design a cost-effective, reproducible microgravity drop vehicle to allow for more easily accessible microgravity research.  
  
There are only a few drop towers in Florida and this project would prove the concept for a low-cost alternative to creating a drop tower.  
The vehicle would house a 2U cubesat and be dropped from a drone at 400ft, using a thrusting system with a thrust profile
that would allow the vehicle overcome drag/air resistance and record it's g value which should approach 1/1,000,000 of Earth's gravity.
  
  
This repo includes the C++ code for the Arduino control system, and relevant CAD files for the geometry of the vehicle itself.


### Final CAD design of the vehicle
